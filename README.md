This repository contains scripts and data I used or created in support of my work, ["Disturbances of Thalamus and Prefrontal Cortex Contribute to Cognitive Aging: A Structure-function Coupling Analysis Based on KL Divergence "].

Data and scripts are organized into three subfolders. 

# `Code`

## `Coupling_Cal`
The folder includes scripts for extracting GMV and ALFF signals from brain regions, calculating probability distribution functions (PDFs), calculating KL divergence, calculating whole brain and regional structure-function coupling. 
## `Correlation_analysis`
The folder includes scripts for regression analysis between structure-function coupling and age, partial correlation analysis and mediation analysis between structure-function coupling and fluid intelligence, reaction time, as well as split-half validation analysis. 

# `Data_Coupling`
The folder includes individual regional structure-function coupling values for BN and HOA atlas, respectively. 

# `Template`
The folder includes BN and HOA brain atlas in nii format files.
